# Resources

Below is an incomplete collection of many resources for learning and applying XState in real-world applications. Check out the [Awesome XState](https://github.com/darrylhebbes/awesome_xstate) collection on GitHub for even more resources!

## Courses

:::tip Official Course
Watch the official [State Machines in JavaScript with XState](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/xstate/) course by [@davidkpiano](https://twitter.com/davidkpiano) on Frontend Masters! In this course, you’ll learn the fundamentals of state machines and statecharts, from building your own without any libraries in pure JavaScript, up to using XState to take advantage of a wide variety of other features.

The workshop code examples are [open-sourced and available on GitHub](https://github.com/davidkpiano/frontend-masters-xstate-workshop).
